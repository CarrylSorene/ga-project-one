//var to store scores: player1 (and player2)
var player1 = 0;

// array to store card combinations: ['dinosaur', giraffe', 'goat', 'lion', 'snake', 'zebra']

//click event
//show image
//then second click same result on that card

//decide if pair matches - two divs ids can't be the same, so ids eg if (div id === lion1) && (div id === lion2)
// ( === dinosaur1) && ( === dinogoat2) / ( === giraffe1) && ( === giraffe2) / ( === goat1) && ( === goat2) /
// ( === snake1) && ( === snake2) / ( === zebra1) && ( === zebra2)

//if pair matched - change colour of back of card and make them unplayable
//splice cards out of array to playedCards array (or playerOnePile and playerTwoPile if get that far)



//decide winner - total number of matched pairs stored in player's variable. Or it's a tie.


//declare winner or tie - change html.
