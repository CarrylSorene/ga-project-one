Technologies used:

HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the jQuery library.

Approach taken:

The game's aimed at young children so the board is large with cute pictures, rounded corners on the cards and a finger-paint style font. Planning was done in Trello and updated throughout the project. HTML and CSS stayed simple, and jQuery was used as much as possible. Ideas of how to code parts of the JavaScript and jQuery began in planning and changed as soon as they were implemented as I discovered better ways to do them. Once the code was almost complete, sections of it were separated to be easier to read and since it wasn't running properly. 

Installation instructions:

Load the URL in your browser and you should be ready to play.

Unsolved problems:

To reset the game, the players need to refresh the browser. If a player clicks on a card that has already been matched, the turn changes and that card disappears if the next one that's clicked isn't a match.
